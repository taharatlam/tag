Digital Audio has been evolving since 1975 and there has been tremendous improvement that the format has brought into our day-to-day lives as well as in Professional Audio. Without doubt, Digital Audio is the future too with endless possibilities that the format can deliver. This theory module explains the fundamentals of DIGITAL AUDIO such as Sampling, Quantisation, Bit-Depth, Analog-to-Digital Conversion, Digital Signal Processing, working principle of various Digital hardware Interfaces as well as Software DAW&#39;s.

These consoles also take care of your various &ldquo;mixes&rdquo; provided to artists and audiences. Considering the wide range of application and processing, these devices can get a little overwhelming for an audio enthusiast. At TAG with a careful study and analysis of various teaching methods, we have crafted a unit that give student ample amount of hands on exposure and provides all the necessary building block for the same.

On top of this, students explore these principles in the live sound industry, understanding and applying the right techniques which are relevant for their sound in any live concert.
